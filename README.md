## Project
This repository contains a script that can be used to investigate the graduates of three different education levels in a specific school year between 2005 and 2017. Besides two files that contain the male and female graduates (geslaagden_mannen.csv and geslaagden_vrouwen.csv), this repository contains four files that specify the amount of males and femalese that were eligible to take part in the exams of 2016/'17 and 2017/'18.

## Motivation
The project this repository is associated with aims to investigate the amount of male and female graduates in order to find out if gender as an impact on graduating.

## Code Style
The script in this repository is written using Linux shell commands.

## Usage
When the user runs the script will first prompt the user what year the user wants to investigate. This number has to be between 2005 and 2017. When the user has entered a year, the script prompts the user to enter one of the three education levels that are used in the Netherlands. When the user has entered both these parameters correctly the script will return the amount of male and female graduates in that year and level.
